Do you want to generate metrics of one execution or compare two executions? (1 for one execution) (2 for two executions)
Do you want to calculate metrics for a single generation or for all generations? (0 for single generation) (1 for all generations)

 Enter the number of objectives : Enter name of first file with information of evolution (max 30 characters)

 Enter the population size in first file : 
 Enter the desired generation in first file: Enter name of second file with information of evolution (max 30 characters)

 Enter the population size in second file : 
 Enter the desired generation in second file: \nnDo you want to calculate reference point for hypervolume automatically? (0 for NO) (1 for YES)

Enter the coordinate of the reference point corresponding to objective #1: 
Enter the coordinate of the reference point corresponding to objective #2: Reference point for hypervolume calculation
